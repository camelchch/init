1.Edit the file 

/etc/hostname

2.Delete the exsting name and replace it with a new name:

Newname

3.Save and close the file. You may also need to edit the /etc/hosts file, enter:

# vim /etc/hosts

4.Find all references to server1 and replace with Newname:

127.0.0.1    localhost
127.0.1.1    Newname

5.Save and close the file. Please note that the host name is usually set once at system startup in /etc/init.d/hostname.sh (normally by reading the contents of a file which contains the host name, e.g. /etc/hostname). Just type the following command to apply new changes without rebooting the server:

# /etc/init.d/hostname.sh start
OR
# invoke-rc.d hostname.sh start
